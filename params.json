Zoom in, pan around, turn layers on and off, click photo icons to see image thumbnails in popups, click the thumbnails to see the images enlarged. Most items have mouseover tooltips, and what you see changes upon zoom level.) \r\n\r\nLast Fall I had an idea for making a unique style of trip report that provides an interactive first-person POV experience, merged with the birds-eye view of the route traveled. I had already climbed the route with my friend Nic Risser, sleeping atop Big Sandy for my 30th BDay in August, so I also had photo documentation of the route. \r\n\r\nI had no idea how I would do this, apart from knowing that I needed photo material to work with and would have to learn JavaScript to implement it. So on my last weekend out before my first of 3 knee surgeries, I hiked to the summit of North Dome with my camera and took a lot of closeup shots of Half Dome, and during my down time this winter, I figured out how to make this idea a reality. \r\n\r\nThe project is still very much unfinished (and yes, Justin, I still need to add photos from your climb!), but it is working, and really fun as-is, and I see myself waiting too long before sharing it if I wait until it is 'finished'. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Process\r\nI created the image with photos taken using a 7-year-old Nikon D40 DLSR, with a Nikkor kit lens. (55-200mm zoom). I merged the image together in Adobe Photoshop, but not without some trial and error for such a big project.\r\n\r\n![Result of attempting to blend all of the photos at once in Adobe Photoshop.](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-zUrB5HbC7LU/UmdJU1LeBTI/AAAAAAADblc/Kdet1XewOnM/s800/2013-10-20%2520-%2520043%2520-%2520Solo%2520TR%2520%2526%2520North%2520Dome%2520-%2520ObamaCareToHalfDome.jpg)\r\n_**Result of attempting to blend all of the photos at once in Adobe Photoshop.**_\r\n\r\nHowever, with some experimentation, I found a way to get the merging to work correctly.\r\n\r\n![NW Face of Half Dome, roughly as I had divided it up into close up photographs taken with a 200mm zoom lens.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YR35dlwmxf0/U1MSGTFSuCI/AAAAAAADdsc/O_YHAv-Uzn0/s800/2013-10-20%2520-%2520046%2520-%2520Solo%2520TR%2520%2526%2520North%2520Dome%2520-%2520IMG_3387%2520-%2520process.jpg)\r\n_**NW Face of Half Dome, roughly as I had divided it up into close up photographs taken with a 200mm zoom lens.**_\r\n\r\nOnce the image was assembled, I had the problem that the image was 75MB, which took far too long to load on a web browser to be a feasible way for a user to quickly view the image. There are a number of JavaScript methods & plugins for  photo enlarging, but most did not allow some form of interactivity on the map that would scale and pan with the image.\r\n\r\nI spent some time trying out one that could handle keeping image maps scaled and aligned with the image, but it was appearing to be a dead end.\r\n\r\nSo I tried tiling, which handles the size and sizing issues. Using this system also allowed for using various interactive elements (icons, polylines, shapes), positioned by latitude  longitude coordinates, as this system is normally used for maps. Since my project was a flat image and not a curved 3D surface on Earth, I had to write some 'unproject' methods in my scripts, but otherwise everything worked together smoothly.\r\n\r\n![I used Tiling to make to make the high resolution Half Dome image feasible for web viewing, with panning and zoom navigation.

There are various Ruby and Python scripts available to do such things, although figuring out how to get them to work is tedious (I really don't know either programming language).","google":"UA-63581746-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
