<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>

<p>(Make sure to go full screen for the best experience. Zoom in, pan around, turn layers on and off, click photo icons to see image thumbnails in popups, click the thumbnails to see the images enlarged. Most items have mouseover tooltips, and what you see changes upon zoom level.) </p>

<p>Last Fall I had an idea for making a unique style of trip report that provides an interactive first-person POV experience, merged with the birds-eye view of the route traveled. I had already climbed the route with my friend Nic Risser, sleeping atop Big Sandy for my 30th BDay in August, so I also had photo documentation of the route. </p>

<p>I had no idea how I would do this, apart from knowing that I needed photo material to work with and would have to learn JavaScript to implement it. So on my last weekend out before my first of 3 knee surgeries, I hiked to the summit of North Dome with my camera and took a lot of closeup shots of Half Dome, and during my down time this winter, I figured out how to make this idea a reality. </p>

<p>The project is still very much unfinished (and yes, Justin, I still need to add photos from your climb!), but it is working, and really fun as-is, and I see myself waiting too long before sharing it if I wait until it is 'finished'. </p>

<a id="process" class="anchor" href="#process" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Process</h3>

<p>I created the image with photos taken using a 7-year-old Nikon D40 DLSR, with a Nikkor kit lens. (55-200mm zoom). I merged the image together in Adobe Photoshop, but not without some trial and error for such a big project.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-zUrB5HbC7LU/UmdJU1LeBTI/AAAAAAADblc/Kdet1XewOnM/s800/2013-10-20%2520-%2520043%2520-%2520Solo%2520TR%2520%2526%2520North%2520Dome%2520-%2520ObamaCareToHalfDome.jpg" alt="Result of attempting to blend all of the photos at once in Adobe Photoshop.">

<p>However, with some experimentation, I found a way to get the merging to work correctly.</p>

<p>Once the image was assembled, I had the problem that the image was 75MB, which took far too long to load on a web browser to be a feasible way for a user to quickly view the image. There are a number of JavaScript methods &amp; plugins for  photo enlarging, but most did not allow some form of interactivity on the map that would scale and pan with the image.</p>

<p>I spent some time trying out one that could handle keeping image maps scaled and aligned with the image, but it was appearing to be a dead end.</p>

<p>So I tried tiling, which handles the size and sizing issues. Using this system also allowed for using various interactive elements (icons, polylines, shapes), positioned by latitude  longitude coordinates, as this system is normally used for maps. Since my project was a flat image and not a curved 3D surface on Earth, I had to write some 'unproject' methods in my scripts, but otherwise everything worked together smoothly.</p>

<p>The tiling was done using a free Ruby script that automates the process, taking a few seconds to size, crop, and save the files in a format &amp; folder structure that can be read by code for automatically re-assembling the portions of the image that are in view of your screen. There are various Ruby and Python scripts available to do such things, although figuring out how to get them to work is tedious (I really don't know either programming language).</p>
